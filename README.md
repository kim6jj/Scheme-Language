<h2>Scheme<h2>

<p>This is the second project which extends off the first Python Script program in accordance with the Google Maps API. Suppose a salesperson has to visit 'x' number of cities regularly and there are roads between all cities. What is the shortest path that goes through all the cities once and returning to the city of origin? In short, what is the shortest complete circuit? In the beginning of the Scheme program, we must load in the first Python script (which must be modified to generate a scheme module with definitions for a 'cities' constant and a 'distance-matrix' constant for whatever cities you choose). The format must be the same as the definitions in the 'PA2.rkt' file. The 'provide' function indicates the defined constants exported from the module. Once the Python program generates data, you type: python distances.py cities_file > distances.rkt

With this project, we solved the problem presented earlier with a brute force solution to this which generates every circuit from some starting city then looks for the shortest one. As challenging as it was, I am very proud to have actually used this to solve a potential real world problem using a real world application in Google Maps. This exposure was an eye-opener in terms of what the workforce is even if in a slight sense.<p>
